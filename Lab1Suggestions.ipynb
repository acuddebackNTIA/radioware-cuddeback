    "Python is a weakly-typed language. It will try any operation you tell it to on any data type and if it can execute that operation without error it will. In Python, you can add 1 (an integer) to 2.14159 (a double) and get 3.14159, whereas in strongly-typed languages like C++ you would get an error for trying to add two different data types. This makes python a highly flexible language, but it means that you as the user need to be aware of the data types your using to ensure you perform the operations you expect. \n",

You can technically put any datatype you want into either, but numpy arrays usefulness comes from the ability to easily perform matrix operations on them which are not always defined for non-numeric datatyeps."

    "## Summary\n",
    "Numpy arrays are a representation of a strict data type in a weakly-typed language. Numpy arrays can be used for complex, n-dimensional operations with appropriate consideration for vector shape. Python will sometimes provide feedback if array shapes are so mismatched that no operation can be performed between them, but you shoudln't count on it. If numpy can make an assumption to translate an invalid expression to a valid one it will do so without comment. You should always know what operations you're trying to perform, the shapes of the vectors on which you are operating, and what your answer should look like. This will enable you to check the validity of your code and avoid silent bugs that ruin your results without any explanation. "
